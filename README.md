# BrickBreaker
Brick Breaker is a game in which the player must smash a wall of bricks by deflecting a bouncing ball with a paddle. The paddle may move horizontally and is controlled with the user's keyboard array.

The collision detection on the blocks' sides is not perfect (I am currently working on it), but it should be soon.

Sample output (try it!!!):
